# Eeppinen-RPG
Python 3.X RPG game-project made using PyGame. All tips and tricks are welcome.

This game is being developed by Heiggs, you can use the content found here in your own projects if you find it helpful, in those situations I dont ask anything more than a comment; Pros, cons.. What can be done better, was this helpful, tips and tricks etc. 

This is solely a training project to hone up my Python skills as beginner coder.

This project is made with help of tutorials and at the moment with free graphics and sounds found on freegameart which I do not provide.
